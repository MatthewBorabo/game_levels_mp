## "N@tm Blog"
At N@tm there were many displays of art and creativity. I saw one farming-style game that was very interesting and different than the work we are doing. Our game worked well and it was cool to see people experience it for the first time. it seemed to be attracting some parents interestingly. other than that, not much happened but it was an enjoyable night.
